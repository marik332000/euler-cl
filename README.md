These are solutions to the various Project Euler problems in Common
Lisp, updated as I feel like it. These are not necessarily the fastest
solutions but rather simple, clean ones that run in under a minute on
modest hardware.

I enjoy how, provided some extra math functions, so many of the
problems are reduced to a single `loop` form.
