;;; Project Euler - Problem 22

;; Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand
;; first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then
;; working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this
;; value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name
;; score.

;; For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
;; COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name
;; in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

;; What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
